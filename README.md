Python workshop for the CogNovo students

Installation instructions for the Python workshop on Jul 15th 2014.


These instructions explain what you need to install depending on your experience and the
operating system you use.

Windows and Mac users:
---

Everything you need (and much much more) is contained in the free Canopy Express
installation. Canopy is a software bundle containing an integrated editor, Python and
Python packages we will use. You can get the Canopy [here](https://store.enthought.com/downloads/).
Normally, the web browser picks the right installation file for you depending on your
operating system and the architecture, but it is a good idea to verify the choice: make sure
you download the software for the right platform (Windows or Mac), and the right version
(either 32 bit or 64 bit). If you're unsure which version to download you can find the
information by right click on My Computer and Properties in Windows. On Mac follow the
instructions [here](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3696).
Once Canopy is installed, you can check if it works properly by opening Enthought
Canopy. 

Experienced Mac/Linux users:

If you prefer a light-weight solution to Canopy, feel free to obtain Python and only the
packages we will use in the workshop. We will use the [numpy package](www.numpy.org/)and the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/). This solution might require
some fiddling around, so if you do not want to spend time tweaking your computer getting
Canopy is probably a better idea.
Linux users can get everything from the repository.
Experienced Mac users can use [Macports](http://www.macports.org/) to get what they
need from Terminal:
```
sudo port install py27-numpy py27-scipy py27-matplotlib py27-ipython
```
If you require any sort of help, ping Jack, Ivana or a closest nerd to you!
